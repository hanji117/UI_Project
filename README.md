# UI_Project

This project contains a menu UI that I worked on in my spare time. It's a work in progress. You can adjust the audio in settings. The other setting options don't work. To try it out you need to have Unity installed. 
Open the project and under assets click on the folder Scenes. Click on menu. Then press the play button.
