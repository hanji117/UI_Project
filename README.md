# UI_Project

This project contains a menu UI that I worked on in my spare time. It's a work in progress. You can adjust the audio in settings. The back button also functions. The other setting options don't work. To try it out you need to have Unity installed. Download the project and keep going inside the folder until you see The Almanac. You will then be able to open it in Unity. 
Open the project and under assets open the folder Scenes. Click on menu. Then press the play button.
